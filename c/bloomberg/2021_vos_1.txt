Their dev team is 40 people formerly Barclays. That is Win/C#/MSSQL portion. Working towards using MS .Net on linux, not Mono



################ SRE ################
******** Ralph - SRE from other team, Prandeep - SRE from the team

describe SRE practices on the project: a-la Google Nest, IOT, Thermistat, Backend, GUI

Mentioned src code organization, including forking workflow

Automated build

Unit testing/code coverage

Packaging with RPM and hosting on Nexus

Rolling deployment into NTCs using ansible

UAT environment

Monitoring/Alerting using Prometheus/Grafana/AlertManager

Mentioned SLA and 1/2 SLO. Individual lags metricses to narrow down the problem


Didn't know about OpenTracing https://opentracing.io

Mentined that services won't work in AT&T anyways, because you'll never find responsible party


################ Behavioral 1 ################
Tawfeek Lawal - SRE team lead, Noel - mgr eng team

What have I learned on the job?

- Political correctness
- Designing and building big systems

How to instrument legacy Web GUI + Backend + DB system with monitoring

Started talking about intriducing ficticious data set, ficticious set of users and automated `curl` robots to measure end-to-end quality

Then was asked how to troubleshoot users complains, which led to the necessity to correlate log records in all systems and having a concept
of session id.

Then was asked how to convince a component owner in this pipeline to include session id into the log files.
Mentioned:
- Using a mapping between their and ours sessions - which is a poor choice
- Funding them
- Lending them people
- Teaming up with other customers of this component
- Attempting to rewrite

Describe when last time had to rollback

Answered:
- easy when software is deployed using ansible, just remove the RPM from repo and re-play the playbook
- having rollback document ready

Their linux soft is packaged in DEB

They don't use containers as extensively yet


################ Behavioral 2 ################
Gareth Houghon - Mgr all index team

Asking why SRE and why Bloomberg

Asking about most interesting project and drill down on one technical aspect.

Told about BSA and explained how exactly once delivery works using zk.
